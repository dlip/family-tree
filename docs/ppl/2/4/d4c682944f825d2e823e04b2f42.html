				<h4>Narrative</h4>
				<div class="grampsstylednote">
					<p>
					Beginning from the parentage of Rosetta Jaques;<br />
					After the death of her husband and son, Elizabeth (Rosetta's mother) not well, having suffered from whooping cough as a child, and continued bouts of it throughout her life, she continued to care for her 2 remaining daughters for around 3 years until the sickness took her over and she placed each into care, and died less then a year later. Her great aunt said she died a painful death.<br />
					Her Great Aunt Constance, raised Elizabeth Fox after her parents and one other sibling died when she was quite young. At which time there was a whooping cough epidemic.<br />
					Georges sister, Harriet, cared for Elizabeth after his death, and her daughter Mary and Eliza (later Rosetta) until the mother became too unwell.<br />
					Rosetta (born under another name) Eliza, after her first born sister who did not survive, was placed in the care of her Uncle John and Aunt Ann, (her uncle being her father’s eldest brother). Her sister Mary was situated in the care of another Aunt on the Fox side of the family. Eliza was supposed be cared for by Joseph, another brother of Georges, but he was away at the time working, and when he returned, she went to live with them. It was then that she was baptised in 1833, the year of her mother’s death, born 5th July 1829, with 2 other children of Joseph and her aunt Charlotte.<br />
					Her Great Aunt Constance visited with her Aunt Charlotte over spreading rumours of George not being the father of the last born son, who died. She said that Elizabeth was a woman of disrepute, which Constance corrected, making known that she was not to verbalise her condemnation of her adopted daughter. The Aunt Charlotte questioning the time of the sons birth due to Georges being imprisoned for a term coinciding with Elizabeth’s pregnancy. He was sent away for a time because of his acting outside the law on part of his employer, a solicitor, who was his second cousin, and was charged and sent to prison for 6 months. He was later to become a solicitor, but not a well to do man in his profession, his just barely passing the bar.<br />
					Both George and the only surviving son, both died of a bout of pneumonia within months of each other. Elizabeth at the time pregnant with Eliza (Rosetta).<br />
					Rosetta, adored her uncle, but in quiet, never felt any closeness toward her Aunt Charlotte, who was strict in her Baptist upbringing and lack of compassion. She said, her uncle, was often tongue lashed and would seek peace by removing himself from her company and going on long trips away from the home; he often apologising his absence to herself and his other children.<br />
					John and Joseph lived near each other, and Rosetta was to visit her Uncle John’s often, his daughter Sarah being her best friend. She mostly visited when his son was away with the father, her not liking Sarah’s brother. Sarah was to marry later, a note worthy gentleman, and Rosetta continued their friendship, and corresponded with her for a long time after moving to Australia.<br />
					Eliza changed her name to Rosetta Jane, after one of her aunts passed away whom she loved dearly, and in the day it was an old custom to take the others name as a symbol of eternal life. This took place around the time she was to get married.<br />
					Lot was close to Joseph Jaques and became acquainted with Rosetta, and at a fete one day, asked if could visit, as in court Rosetta. Joseph gave his consent. They courted for almost 2 years prior to being married. She thought him a well educated man, and he was tall, and of fair hair and complexion. His manners were of a gentleman. They were married, with close friends as witness. Lot ask for her hand in marriage of her Aunt Charlotte (Lotte) who refused his request; her uncle at the time hospitalised. Rosetta was forbidden to see Lot, after his asking for permission, and so she visited Sarah more often, where Lot and her could be in company, and later boarded with Sarah, infrequently visiting her Aunt.  They were married in the year of 1849, after her Uncle Joseph giving his permission, and her and Lot renting a place of their own. Her Aunt Charlotte never recognised their marriage and attempted to have it disavowed. When she was pregnant with her first, her Aunt came to accept their marriage.<br />
					 <br />
					They settled in Orange, New South Wales. Lot was an adventurous person, and like to take in the sights. On occasion he would sit and relate his stories to his children. <br />
